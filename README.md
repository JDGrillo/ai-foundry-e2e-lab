## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Repository Setup

```powershell
# Clone the laboratory repository
git clone https://github.com/dhangerkapil/ai-foundry-e2e-lab.git
cd ai-foundry-e2e-lab

# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.10 or higher
```

### Step 2: Python Environment Configuration

**Option A: Using UV (Recommended - Fastest)**
```powershell
# Install UV package manager for Windows PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**Option B: Using Standard venv**
```powershell
# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```powershell
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Register Jupyter kernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ai-foundry-lab --display-name="AI Foundry Lab"
```

### Step 4: Azure AI Foundry Setup

1. **Create Azure AI Foundry Project**
   - Navigate to [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com)
   - Create a new project with Standard pricing tier
   - Choose region based on model availability (East US 2 recommended)

2. **Deploy Required Models & Services**
   
   | Model Type | Recommended Models | Purpose |
   |------------|-------------------|---------|
   | **Chat/Completion** | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini` | Primary reasoning & conversation |
   | **Text Embeddings** | `text-embedding-3-large` | Vector search & RAG |
   | **(Optional) Image Embeddings** | `cohere-embed-v3-english` | Image search & multimodal tasks |
   | **Image Generation** | `dall-e-3` | Image creation from text |
   | **Specialized** | `phi-4`, `deepseek-r1` | Domain-specific tasks |

3. **Configure an Azure OpenAI Resource**
   - Create an Azure OpenAI resource in the same region as your AI Foundry project
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure OpenAI

4. **Configure Azure Search Service**
   - Create an Azure AI Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Azure AI Search

5. **Configure Grounding with Bing Search**
   - Create a new Grounding with Bing Search resource in Azure
   - Connect this resource to your AI Foundry project
      - Navigate to your AI Foundry project → Management Center → Connected Resources → Add Connection → Select Grounding with Bing Search

6. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and update values accordingly
   - This repository expects the `.env` file to be in the root directory, if you want to store it elsewhere or name it something else, update the `load_dotenv()` calls in notebooks

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting & Support

### ⚡ Common Issues & Solutions

**Kernel Issues in VS Code:**
```powershell
# Refresh kernel registration
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ai-foundry-lab --display-name="AI Foundry Lab"
# Reload VS Code: Ctrl+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"
```

**Environment Activation Problems:**
```powershell
# Set PowerShell execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

# Verify virtual environment
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

**Azure Authentication Issues:**
```powershell
# Recommended: Use Azure CLI authentication
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show

# Alternative: Clear cached credentials and re-login
az account clear
az login --tenant YOUR_TENANT_ID
az account show
```

> **Note:** If you see deprecation warnings about the Azure Account extension in VS Code, use `az login` in the terminal instead. The Azure Account extension for VS Code has been deprecated in favor of Azure CLI authentication.
